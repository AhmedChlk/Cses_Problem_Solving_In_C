# Cses_Problem_Solving_In_C
## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/) implemented in C. As a second-year computer science student, my goal is to improve my skills in algorithm design and problem solving through practical coding challenges.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
Cses_Problem_Solving_In_C/
├── src/         # C source files for each problem solution
├── include/     # Header files (if any)
├── tests/       # Test cases and scripts for validating solutions
└── README.md    # This file
## Prerequisites
Before compiling the solutions, ensure you have the following installed:
- **GCC**: GNU Compiler Collection for C programming.
- **Make**: (Optional) for build automation if you choose to use a Makefile.
## Installation and Compilation
To compile a specific solution, open your terminal, navigate to the repository directory, and run:
```bash
gcc -o bin/solution_name src/solution_name.c
```
Replace solution_name with the actual name of the file you wish to compile. If a Makefile is provided, you can compile all solutions with:
```bash
make
```
## Running the Solutions
Once compiled, execute the solution using:
```bash
./bin/solution_name
```
Be sure to replace solution_name with the correct executable name.
