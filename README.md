# CSES Problem Set in C

Hi! 👋

This repository contains my solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), all written in **C language**.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/` : Each subfolder corresponds to a problem and contains its `.c` source file  
- `bin/` : Compiled executables are stored here automatically  
- `Makefile` : Used to build and run the code easily

## ▶️ How to Compile & Run

To **compile all problems**:

```bash
make
```
To **compile and run a specific** problem, for example Weird_Algorithm:

```bash
make run RUN=Weird_Algorithm
```

## 🧹 Clean Up

To **delete** all compiled files:

```bash 
make clean
```
This removes the bin/ directory.

## 💡 Why this project?
I'm solving these problems to practice algorithms and improve my C programming skills. This also helps me get more comfortable with Makefile and organizing code for multiple problems.

## 📬 Contact

I'm always open to feedback, suggestions, or improvements!
